Instructions and helpful Tips for Remote Teaching

1. Go to the [Hangouts on Air page](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/onair), click yellow "Create Hangout on Air" button. You also must make sure you have a verified YouTube account associated with the gmail account of the person hosting the hangout.

2. Give it name, description (optional), click starts later and specify time to start. Helpfully,
the Hangout won't automatically start at that time, you still need to press the "Go Live" button in 
the Hangout to start the streaming to YouTube, which you can do before or after the specified time.
Also, I always overestimate the duration of the Hangout, because you can end it at any time. So for
a three hour workshop I'll set it to five hours. If you set this too short, the streaming to YouTube
may stop early and that portion of the video will not be saved.

3. Under "Audience", delete "Public". This would allow anyone to join your Hangout on Air call. 
Because we are recording lectures, we don't want people we don't know joining in and possibly
interrupting the lesson. I put the email address of another instructor here because it will
complain if that box is left blank.

4. Click "Share". This will take you to the Google+ page for the Hangout. 

**To get the links:** Click "Start", and "Skip" on the Invite Guests pop up screen (though it doesn't
hurt anything to invite people because you are not streaming at this point). In the Hangout screen,
click "Links", and this will give you relevant links for the Hangout. Our lab only uses the YouTube 
link here because our Hangout is private, so people can't join from the Google+ Hangout page anyway.

**To invite people:** In the Hangout screen, click the "Invite People" icon at the top center of the
screen. This will give you a pop up screen with the permanent sharing link. I've found that it is easiest
to send this link to whomever you want to join the Hangout instead of messing with giving people access 
via email accounts.

**To make the Hangout live (streaming to YouTube):** Click the green "Start Broadcast" button at the 
bottom of the Hangout screen.


### Other helpful knowledge

* You can join and leave the Hangout and invite others to the hangout as many times as you want before
starting the broadcast.
